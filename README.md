# FedCollect AI

FedCollect AI is an AI-powered debt collection management platform designed to enable ethical, transparent, and efficient debt recovery.

---

## Problem Statement
Traditional debt collection processes rely heavily on manual prioritization and aggressive practices, leading to low recovery efficiency, compliance risks, and poor customer experience.

---

## Proposed Solution
FedCollect AI provides a centralized platform connecting internal financial teams, debt collection agencies, and customers. The system uses AI-driven logic to prioritize cases, assign suitable agents, and monitor compliance.

---

## Key Features
- Role-based access for Internal Teams, DCAs, and Customers
- AI-based case prioritization and agent recommendation
- Trust score generation for agencies
- Logged in-app communication and proof uploads
- Complaint tracking and ethical enforcement

---

## AI Intelligence Layer
The AI module evaluates debt amount, overdue duration, customer history, agent performance, and complaint frequency to generate priority scores, flags, and recommendations.

---

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js / Python (Flask)
- Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB
- AI/ML: Scikit-learn (rule-based ML)
- Cloud: AWS / Firebase

---

## Security & Compliance
- Role-based access control
- Encrypted data storage
- Auditable communication logs
- Complaint escalation mechanism

## UI MVP Prototype

The `ui-mvp` folder contains a functional HTML/CSS-based UI prototype
demonstrating:
- Role-based dashboards (Internal Team, Agent, Customer)
- AI-assisted priority scoring (rule-based MVP)
- Ethical debt collection workflow

This UI is built as a rapid prototype to validate the product concept.
